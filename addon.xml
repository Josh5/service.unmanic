Unmanic is a simple tool for optimising your video library to a single format. The ultimate goal of Unmanic is to take the complexity out of converting your whole media library. The idea is to simply point Unmanic at your library and let it manage it.

Unmanic provides you with the following main functions:

 - A scheduler built in to scan your whole library for files that do not conform to your configured video presets. Videos found with incorrect formats are then queued for conversion.

 - A folder watchdog. When a video file is modified or a new file is added in your library, Unmanic is able to check that video against your configured video presets. Like the first function, if this video is not formatted correctly it is added to a queue for conversion.

 - A handler to manage multiple file conversion tasks at a time using ffmpeg

 - A Web UI to easily configure your preferred video presets and monitor the progress of your library conversion.
